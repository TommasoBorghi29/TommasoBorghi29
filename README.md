## Hi there 👋

🚀 **Hi, I'm Tommaso Borghi**\
Passionate about technology, clean code, and building smart solutions.

👨‍💻 I'm a software developer with a focus on modern, scalable applications — from backend logic to interactive interfaces. Whether it's a small script or a full-stack project, I love diving into code that makes a difference.

🔧 My tools of choice include:

- Languages I know: `ANSI C`, `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- Languages I am learning: `C`, `TypeScript`
- Frameworks & Tools: `React`, `Vite`
- Tech stuff I enjoy: building intuitive UIs, automation, clean architectures, and solving real-world problems with code.

🧠 I’m always learning — currently exploring AI integration in everyday apps, and working on some personal tools to boost productivity.
